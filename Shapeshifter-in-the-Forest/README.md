# Roadmap: Story Platformer Game â€“ "Shapeshifter in the Forest"

This project is a web-based platformer game where you play as a shapeshifting creature trying to fit in with other animals in a magical forest. The game features a branching story, character interactions, and AI-generated graphics. The player's appearance will be generated by AI in real time as they shapeshift to blend in with different animal groups. Graphics will be implemented after core gameplay and story are functional.

### 1. Project Setup
- Initialize project structure (HTML, CSS, JS files)
- Set up a local development server
- Choose a game framework (optional, e.g., Phaser.js or plain JavaScript)

### 2. Core Game Loop
- Create a canvas and render a placeholder background
- Implement the main game loop (update & render functions)
- Add placeholder sprites for player and NPCs

### 3. Story & Dialogue System
- Design the main story arc: the shapeshifter's journey to fit in
- Create a dialogue system for player-NPC interactions
- Write dialogue for multiple animal characters (e.g., fox, owl, rabbit, bear)
- Implement branching choices and consequences

### 4. Player Character Mechanics
- Implement player movement (left, right, jump)
- Add gravity and collision with the ground
- Add shapeshifting mechanic (change abilities/appearance based on animal group)
- Use placeholder graphics for shapeshifting until AI graphics are ready

### 5. Platforms & Level Design
- Create static platforms and level layout
- Add boundaries (walls, floor, ceiling)
- Design levels to encourage interaction with different animal groups

### 6. NPCs & Animal Groups
- Add NPCs representing different animal groups
- Implement basic AI for NPC movement and interaction
- Integrate dialogue and story progression with NPCs

### 7. Collectibles, Goals & Progression
- Add collectible items (e.g., forest tokens)
- Implement win/lose conditions (e.g., acceptance by animal groups, story endings)

### 8. Graphics Integration (AI-Generated)
- Integrate AI-generated graphics for backgrounds, NPCs, and environment
- Implement real-time AI graphics generation for the shapeshifting player
- Replace placeholder art with final assets

### 9. Polish & UI
- Add score, inventory, and dialogue UI
- Add start, win, and game over screens
- Add sound effects and background music (optional)

### 10. Deployment
- Optimize assets and code for the web
- Deploy the game online (e.g., GitHub Pages)

---
**Notes:**
- Focus on story and dialogue early; graphics will be added after core gameplay and story are functional.
- Dialogue and story choices are central to the experience.
- AI-generated graphics will be integrated in later stages for both the environment and the shapeshifting player.
